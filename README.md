    <h1>CSS</h1>
    
        <p>Before I dive into the ins and outs of CSS why don't we start with a little background?</p>
        <p>Ok! So CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. I don't know really know what that exactly means but essentially CSS spices up the webpage by adding style to it. This is a good thing if you are like me because looking at a black and white screen is a bit dull. Learniing CSS will add some depth to your coding skills and make your webpages look a lit cooler.</p>
        
    <h3>Color!!!</h3>
        
        <p>So the first thing to learn about CSS is the color attribute. This will really make your website pop!</p>
        
    <h4>Steps to Adding Color </h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>The first step to adding color to a webpage is adding the style tag. This tag essentially lets the browser know that everything in the page will be using CSS. The style tag is... <style>.</li>
            <li></li>
        
        </ol>
