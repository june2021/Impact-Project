<h1>CSS</h1>

<p>Before I dive into the ins and outs of CSS why don't we start with a little background?
  <br> Ok! So CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet and I don't really know what the means but essentially with CSS you get to add style to a webpage. Whcih if you're like me is a good thing because looking at a colorless and bland webpage is not that fun so you definitely want to learn how to spice up your coding skills. </p>
